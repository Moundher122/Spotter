# Spotter v1 — Overview

## What it does

Given a **start** and **end** location, the system finds the cheapest fuel stops for a truck along the driving route.

## How it works (high level)

1. **Geocode** the start and end locations into coordinates.
2. **Fetch the driving route** from OSRM (coordinates → polyline + total distance).
3. **Find gas stations** along the route from the database.
4. **Optimize fuel stops** using dynamic programming to minimize total fuel cost.
5. **Return** the optimal stops, total cost, total gallons, and the route polyline.

## Key assumption

Stations are considered to be **on the route**. We project each station onto the nearest point of the route polyline and assign it a `distance_from_start` value. From that point on, the station is treated as if it sits directly on the route at that mile marker. We do not account for detour distance to reach a station off the highway.

## Constraint

The truck has a **maximum range of 500 miles** on a full tank. The optimizer ensures that the gap between any two consecutive stops (including start and destination) never exceeds this range. Stations are **not** filtered by absolute distance from the start — a station at mile 1500 is valid as long as the truck can reach it through intermediate stops.

## Output

- List of fuel stops (where to stop, how many gallons to buy, cost at each stop)
- Total fuel cost (globally optimal)
- Total distance and total gallons
- Encoded route polyline for map display
